# Copilot Metrics Viewer

## Introduction

The Copilot Metrics Viewer is a comprehensive project designed to collect, process, and visualize metrics related to GitHub Copilot usage. This project is divided into two main components:

1. **Front-End (FE)**: A Vue.js application that provides a user interface for visualizing the collected metrics.
2. **DataPipeline**: A data pipeline that handles the collection, processing, and storage of metrics data.

## Components

### Front-End (FE)

The front-end component is a Vue.js application that visualizes the metrics collected by the data pipeline. It provides various charts and graphs to help users understand their Copilot usage.

For more details, refer to the [FE README](FE/README.md).

### DataPipeline

The data pipeline component is responsible for collecting, processing, and storing metrics data. It uses various tools and technologies such as Kafka, PySpark, and Airflow to handle the data.

For more details, refer to the [DataPipeline README](DataPipeline/README.md).

### Back-End (BE)
Coming soon...
